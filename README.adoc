= Send e-mail with GMail SMTP server

Here I show you how to send e-mail with GMail's SMTP server via Apache Common Email library.

== Requirement

You need a Google account to run this application.

Before running, go to https://www.google.com/settings/security/lesssecureapps and turn on
`Access for less secure apps` option.

== Other GMail options

For detail see: https://support.google.com/a/answer/176600?hl=en

For short, maybe you can send email with `aspmx.l.google.com` if all
people receiving your mail will use GMail.
